Eolus is our open source attempt to join the forces of an IaaS-Cloud (currently OpenNebula) and Java Enterprise Edition. It is far from achieving end product quality, yet it provides functionality that serves the needs of our lab (MaDgIK
http://www.madgik.di.uoa.gr/ ) at the University of Athens.

In short, the cloud middleware (OpenNebula) is used as a management tool for virtual resources that we exploit in building higher level custom services available through a JEE application container. An advance VM scheduler called Nefeli and a web based administration console are only a couple of such high level
components we offer to users. Our success stories include undergraduate theses, researchers and European funded projects experimenting and exploiting cloud
resources. Our software is released under the EUPL licence.
